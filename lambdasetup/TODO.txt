DONE
- Email alert on non-categorized items
- Smarter queue implementation - no need to send file, just use getqueubyname

TODO

- Set up output DB
- Push output to DB
- Set up separately triggered Lambda to recompute old file if categories are given  



- Optimal resolution process
    Send email with link
    Link spins up a VM
    VM runs a web UI to input choices
        Choose choices
        Click apply
    Sends choices to categories.json
    Triggers reprocessing of THE AFFECTED budget.txt files



Server-based approach
- have a running EC2 micro instance with a UI Server
    Ability to VIEW past record
    Ability to GENERATE new record - copy paste text file
        Go through process - ask when things go wrong and solve them on the spot
